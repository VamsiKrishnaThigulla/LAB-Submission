USE OF GCD:

1.A simple method to find time for polling. For exaple we have two I/O devices one capable of changing state every 10ms, and 
the other changing state every 15 ms, then if we want to check for I/O we can find the gcd of the response times (5 ms) and 
use this to  get the frequency at which polling can be done. This is however not always optimal (if times are coprime), in 
such a case the complexity of the code/ hardware can be increased to optimise operation.

2.If uniform blocks of memory are required, then GCD of available free space will give the maximum block size which can be used,
such that no memory is wasted.
